Database normalization is the process of organizing 
the attributes and tables of a relational database 
to minimize data redundancy.

Normalization involves decomposing a table into 
less redundant (and smaller) tables but without 
losing information; defining foreign keys in the 
old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. 
The objective is to isolate data so that additions, 
deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be 
made in just one table and then propagated through 
the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.
