A relational DBMS is special system software
that is used to manage the organization, 
storage, access, security and integrity of data.  
This specialized software allows application systems 
to focus on the user interface, data validation 
and screen navigation.  
When there is a need to add, modify, delete or display data, 
the application system simply makes a "call" to the RDBMS.
